How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's quite good unless you have't knowledge about Git.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's very usefull. At any point of time if we have to access the our 
    old content then we can access directly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are it gives you a choice and you commit when you need and commit history 
    doesn't clutter.
    Cons are if we commit big then It's hard to find the bug.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It's easy to track the chanegs made in different files. If we commit multiple 
    files in multiple commit then it is very tedious task to track the changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log command is used when we want to know about the commit history and
    git diff command is used when we want to analize the changes between two 
    different commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's quite good. We can do changes easily to our code without worrying 
    about the errors. If something happens then we can checkout to our previous
    commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Want to try some real world project using Git.
